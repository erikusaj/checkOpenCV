# checkOpenCV
Script to check OpenCV version

Node script for checking OS version, Node, Npm and OpenCV versions.

I am observing issues installing Npm module _opencv_ Node Bindings to OpenCV from [npm opencv ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv) on several Vagrant boxes and Docker containers. Therefore creating s script to try identify the issue.
